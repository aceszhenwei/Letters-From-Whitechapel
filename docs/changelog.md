# Changelog

## Unreleased: interface and documentation

- **New interface:** a dark Victorian frame around a parchment board, a sidebar with the current phase, instructions and progress, Jack's public status and a case log, plus intro and game-over dialogs.
- **Board:** circle numbers are visible, streets are drawn as dotted lines from the map data, and tokens are modelled on the physical pieces (coloured policemen, translucent clue and crime scene markers).
- **Responsive:** the board scales to fit; on narrow screens the page becomes one column with the instructions first.
- **Fixes:** phase text no longer repeats every round; map pieces have proper `px` positions (they only worked in quirks mode before).
- **Documentation:** a new `docs/` folder.

## Following the rulebook ([aceszhenwei/Letters-From-Whitechapel#3](https://github.com/aceszhenwei/Letters-From-Whitechapel/pull/3))

- Women and Wretched per night, patrol placement on later nights, and a hideout that is never a red circle.
- The Time of the Crime token, the order of Suspense grows and Ready to kill, Wretched movement limits, and crime scenes that stay all game.
- The double event, the move track (15 to 19 moves), escape only by a normal move, and one action per policeman.

## Alleys, coaches and tests ([aceszhenwei/Letters-From-Whitechapel#2](https://github.com/aceszhenwei/Letters-From-Whitechapel/pull/2))

- Alleys computed from the map's blocks, and Jack's coach and alley moves.
- Automated unit and regression tests with jsdom, run by GitHub Actions.
- Fixes: finding a clue redrew the map, Jack couldn't walk through map id 0, and crime scene tokens piled up.

## Game logic fixes ([aceszhenwei/Letters-From-Whitechapel#1](https://github.com/aceszhenwei/Letters-From-Whitechapel/pull/1))

- Fixed out-of-range random picks, the hideout choice, `jack.canMove`, Jack heading home, and several display bugs.
- Added game endings and new nights.
